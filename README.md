# WebTube

This project is a replica of the YouTube homepage, and built through a course from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymGB1lqP1CM&t=3580s). There is a complex sidebar that utilizes React contexts, and Tailwind CSS for mobile customizations.

For future state, the app will have deeper pages, live data, and client access through login authentication.
